## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bootstrap, Node, Express, MongoDB
My goal for this project was to create a fullstack web application that allowed users to upload images to share with other users. 

## Optimizations
To improve this project I would allow users to show which user posted the image. If had the time, I would convert this ejs project to React.

## Lessons Learned:
I was able to implement MongoDB for the database as well as use Node and Express for the backend
